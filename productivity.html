    <h1>Mastering Productivity</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Productivity isn’t about doing more. It’s about doing what matters. You can be busy all day and still get nothing important done. True productivity is about focus, priorities, and energy.</p>

    <p>Start with clarity. What are your most important tasks? Not the urgent ones — the ones that truly move your life or goals forward. Make a list of your top 3 tasks each day and start with the hardest one. That’s the “Eat the Frog” method.</p>

    <p>Time blocking helps too. Set aside chunks of time with no distractions — no phone, no tabs, no multitasking. Use tools like the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes work, 5 minutes break) to stay sharp.</p>

    <p>Also, manage your energy. You’re not a robot. Sleep, nutrition, and rest matter more than you think. Don’t wait until you burn out to care for your mind and body.</p>

    <p>Productivity is a lifelong skill. It’s not about being perfect — it’s about building habits that support your focus, energy, and goals. Master this, and anything becomes possible.</p>
