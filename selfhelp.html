    <h1>Self-Help That Actually Works</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Self-help isn’t about reading motivational quotes all day. It’s about taking small, meaningful actions to improve your life. Whether you're working on confidence, habits, or time management, true growth starts with awareness and consistency.</p>

    <p>The first step in self-help is understanding yourself. What are your strengths and weaknesses? What’s holding you back? Journaling, reflection, and mindfulness are powerful tools. They help you tune in instead of tuning out.</p>

    <p>Next, set goals — not just big dreams, but small, daily habits that move you forward. Want to be more confident? Practice speaking up once a day. Want to be more focused? Start with 10-minute deep work sessions. Progress is slow at first, but it snowballs.</p>

    <p>Cut out comparison. Your journey is your own. Social media can make everyone else look perfect, but they’re not. Focus on getting 1% better every day, not being the best overnight.</p>

    <p>Remember: true self-help is action. Reading is step one. Doing is step two. You’ve already started by being here. Now go apply what you learn — and watch your life transform.</p>
